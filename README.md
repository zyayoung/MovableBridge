### Create a Circuit Diagram

Our brigde must know whether there is a car A or B on it and whether there is a big car (ship) is waiting below or passing. To fufil this requirement, we need two infrared object sensor to judge whether there is a car on the bridge and two ultrasonic distance sensors to detect whethere is a ship waiting/passing under the brigde.

Next, we must raise the bridge when there is a ship waiting under the bridge and there is no car on the bridge. To fufil this requirement, we need two DC motors and a DC motor driver.

Then, we need to stop the car when the brigde is going to raise or have been raised, so we need a servo (to raise and lower the blocking system) and two LEDs (red and green) each side.

Further more, we need an arduino to read the sensors and control the brigde-raising system and the car-blocking system.

In the circuit diagram, we label all 5v by red and GND by black.
